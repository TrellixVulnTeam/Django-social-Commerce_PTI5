this is a django social commerce code.
it has ebdjango because it was once hosted on AWS you can check it to see how your code behaves when you ship code to ebdjango 
although what basically happens is it creates a copy of your code there...

martinn folder is the settings folder...#

you need django 2.0.7 to run the code

when running, there are two types of users, shops and regular clients... shops have more access and their profiles are,
shown as shopps .. you can view the shopp folder.. 

This is a combination of a social media and an ecommerce in plain english...
